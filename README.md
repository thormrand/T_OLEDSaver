# T_OLEDSaver

**T_OLEDSaver** is a lightweight World of Warcraft addon designed to protect OLED monitors from screen burn-in during periods of inactivity.

## Features

* **OLED Protection:** Completely blacks out the screen after a set period of inactivity.
* **Cursor Hiding:** Automatically hides the mouse cursor to prevent static element burn-in.
* **WoW Trivia:** Displays random World of Warcraft facts while the screensaver is active.
* **Instant Wake:** Seamlessly returns to the game the moment you move your mouse or press a key.

> **Note:** For the best results and true black output, please ensure you are running World of Warcraft in **Fullscreen** mode.

## Usage

The addon works automatically out of the box.

* **Activation:** Automatically starts after **5 minutes** (300 seconds) of inactivity.
* **Deactivation:** Move the mouse or press any key to resume play immediately.
